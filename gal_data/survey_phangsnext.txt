NGC0278
# Classic EDGE on - lowest priority here
NGC891
# ALMA archive + proposal target
NGC1068
# Mild selection miss + good HST
NGC1291
# Was allocated ALMA time. Proposed. Very nearby.
NGC1313

NGC2403
# Nearby northern (not impossible ALMA) inclined target - low priority
NGC2683

# Bad selection miss + proposal target
NGC3368
# M108 - Inclined, northern, close-ish. Lower priority.
NGC3556
# M065 - Inclined and distance uncertain but specs out as big and close.
NGC3623

# Sombrero - very early type, edge on. Still...
NGC4594
# Edge on with ALMA data (though not part of PHANGS)
NGC4565
# Edge on with IRAM data - lower interest unless we go that way
